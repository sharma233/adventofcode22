# Advent of Code 2022

This is a repository to hold all my solutions working through Advent of Code 2022. Not sure if I'm going to get through the whole thing but I will keep going while I'm having fun with it!

Also worth noting that some of the solutions might be somewhat janky in here, there are times I just brute forced a naive solution and didn't feel like going back to optimize them due to time constraints/lack of interest.
